# One-pager: U.S. Startup Investing — What It Looks Like Now, and How Taiwanese Public Companies Can Participate

**Audience:** Taiwanese public-company executives (and family)  
**Format:** 15-minute talk + Q&A  
**Working title:** From Silicon Valley: the U.S. startup investing landscape and practical ways for Taiwanese companies to engage

## Who I am
- Engineering leader at **PitchBook** (Marketing Platform Engineering).
- Day job: build internal platforms that help our go-to-market teams execute reliably (lead orchestration, automation, data/ops plumbing).

## Why I’m sharing this
I’m not selling a fund or product. The goal is to translate what I see in the U.S. market into a small set of decision-useful patterns for Taiwanese listed companies:
- What has changed since “easy money” years
- Where the real heat is (and where it isn’t)
- How corporates can participate without turning themselves into a VC firm

## My current scope at PitchBook (what I do day-to-day)
- **Systems I own:** marketing automation + lead routing + enrichment + account creation workflows (platform + integrations).
- **Stakeholders:** Marketing Ops, RevOps, Sales Ops, and engineering teams.
- **My lens:** how technology and GTM execution translate to durable business outcomes.

## What I’ll cover (15 minutes)
1) **U.S. market snapshot (what’s true right now)**  
   - Capital is back in selective pockets; dollars are concentrated in fewer, bigger rounds (especially AI).
   - Expectations are higher: product maturity and revenue proof matter earlier.
   - Many startups are “stuck” between seed and Series A; they need strategic partners, not just money.

2) **Why this matters for Taiwanese public companies**  
   - Taiwan’s strengths (manufacturing, supply chain position, B2B customer access) are *exactly* what many U.S. startups lack.
   - The corporate edge is not “beating Silicon Valley VCs at their own game,” but creating **options**:
     - technology radar
     - new product lines
     - partner/BD pipeline
     - selective M&A pathways

3) **Practical participation options (low-risk → higher-commitment)**  
   - **LP in a reputable fund** (learn + diversify; outsource sourcing/diligence)
   - **Strategic co-invest** alongside a trusted lead investor (invest + commercial partnership)
   - **Small, focused CVC / investment committee** as an extension of strategy/R&D (not a stand-alone “VC org”)

## What “good” looks like (simple guardrails)
- Start small (budget and staffing), iterate annually.
- Pick 2–3 themes tied to your core business (avoid scattershot investing).
- Insist on a clear collaboration path (pilots, manufacturing partner, distribution, joint roadmap).
- Avoid pure FOMO rounds where pricing is set by hype, not traction.

## What I’m collecting next (to tailor the talk)
- 2–4 **Taiwanese public-company examples** of CVC or growth-stage investing (case-style: why they invested, how they worked with the startup, what changed).
- Sector preferences of the audience (AI in manufacturing, semicap equipment, industrial software, EV supply chain, etc.).
