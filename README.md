# Lighthouse

A small collection of field notes and signals from the U.S. startup ecosystem,
written for Taiwanese public-company executives.

This is **not** investment advice and **not** a fund or product.
The intent is orientation, not prediction.

## What this is
- A 15-minute talk + 1-pager on the current U.S. startup / VC landscape
- A practical framing for how corporates can engage:
  - technology radar
  - strategic options
  - selective growth-stage investing / CVC

## What this is not
- Not a pitch deck
- Not a venture fund
- Not trend-chasing

## Contents
- `/site` — a simple, QR-friendly one-page website
- `/one-pager` — shareable summaries (ZH / EN)
- `/notes` — speaker notes and references

## Status
Work in progress. Content will evolve based on audience and discussion.
